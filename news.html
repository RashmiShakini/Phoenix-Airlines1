                            Hurricanes have long been the cause of flight cancellations, especially in regions with severe hurricane seasons. Yet, modern aircraft have been designed to withstand much of the challenges brought by such strong storms.

                        <p>
                            A computer glitch gave customers a mirage that they could get an Etihad return flight from Australia to Europe for around $200.
                            Late last week, an unknown number of people, probably mainly Australians, thought they had struck it lucky. They discovered they could get return tickets from Australia to Europe for around AU$300 ($196),                   </p>

                        <p>In the glamour days of airline travel — that is, before we all became cargo — carriers had to abide by the little-known Rule 240. That regulation dictated that if, say, your Trans World Airlines flight from New York to Los Angeles was delayed by four hours, and Pan Am had space on an earlier departure, TWA had to revalidate your ticket on Pan Am. Only catch was: You had to know the rule.</p>
